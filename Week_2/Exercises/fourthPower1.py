#Write a Python function, fourthPower, that takes in one number and returns that
#value raised to the fourth power.

#You should use the square procedure that you defined in an earlier exercise 
#(you don't need to redefine square in this box; when you call square, the grader will use our definition).

#This function takes in one number and returns one number.

def fourthPower(x):
    return x**4

print(fourthPower(2))
